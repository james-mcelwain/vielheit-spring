/**
 * A class that provides callable instances -- i.e. instances that share function call
 * semantics.
 *
 * Note, this implementation should *not* be considered stable. "Function" is described
 * by the ECMAScript specification as an "intrinsic object" -- i.e. native code -- found
 * as a property of the global object (window.Function).
 *
 * The specification notes regarding subclassing:
 *
 *  The Function constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
 *  the value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors
 *  that intend to inherit the specified Function behaviour must include a super
 *  call to the Function constructor to create and initialize a subclass instances
 *  with the internal slots necessary for built-in function behaviour. All
 *  ECMAScript syntactic forms for defining function objects create instances of
 *  Function. There is no syntactic means to create instances of Function subclasses
 *  except for the built-in Generator Function subclass
 *
 * In Chrome, when super is called, a truly anonymous function is created. In order to
 * bind the "this" context of the subclass, it is necessary to return a bounded instance
 * of the superclass function from the subclass constructor.

 * A less sketchy way to provide a callable object, by mapping and binding properties
 * of a pre-existing class instance. *However*, it is important to note that this does
 * not preserve the class instance's nominal type -- i.e. `instanceof` is not preserved.
 *
 * F represent a function of any type that will be grafted on to our callable class.
 * As such the "this" context of the function cannot be guaranteed. We attempt to bind below
 * but the type signature itself does not provide a "this," just callable semantics.
 *
 * If "this" context needs to be available, a non-arrow function should be passed to guarantee a
 * bound function is passed post-transpilation.
